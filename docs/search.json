    "text": "The question objective, and motivation\nObjective:\nThe purpose of this research is to explore the trend in Australia’s inflation rate over the next two years.\nQuestion:\nWill Australia’s inflation rate fall back to the 2-3% inflation target range in 2025, and will it reach 2.5% in 2026?\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) forecasts that inflation will fall back to the target range of 2% to 3% by 2025 and reach the midpoint of this range in 2026. The purpose of the study is to forecast inflation over the next two years and assess the reasonableness of the RBA’s forecast. This is because we have observed a sharp rise in inflation to 7.8% during COVID-19, and in response the RBA implemented tightening monetary policy and increased interest rates starting in late 2022. Entering mid-to-late 2023, the pace of interest rate increases has slowed down. This research will help determine whether the RBA correctly assumed that its monetary policy measures have effectively suppressed inflation and expected that inflation will fall back to the target range over the next year."

Therefore, its logarithmically transformed form will be used in the following analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Line graph of original data\n\nIntegration transformation\n\nAccording to ACF plot for all data (Figure 2), we can see all data with autocorrelation. It suggests that the series is not white noise and might not be stationary. In this case, applying a differencing operation, such as a first difference (single-order integration), can help remove the autocorrelation and achieve stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 ACF Plot for all data\nConsidering the selection of the order of single-order integration, the unit root test (ADF test) is used and the p value is used to determine its significance. A small p-value means the null hypothesis is rejected (non-stationary).\nAccording to Table 1, we can see that \\(cpi_i\\), \\(crt_i\\), \\(nloan_i\\) and \\(limport_i\\) require more than second-order integration, while \\(gold_i\\), \\(unemp_i\\), \\(lexport_i\\) require sencond-order integration, other variables require first-order integration (under 10% level of confidence and n in the table means larger than 2).\n\n\n          \n0.2378902 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np value of ADF test of AR\np value of ADF test of diff-AR\np value of ADF test of diff-diff-AR\nconclusion\n\n\n\n\nlcpi\n0.9328\n0.6733\n0.2018\nlcpi~I(n)\n\n\ngold\n0.3959\n0.3375\n0.0862\ngold~I(2)\n\n\ngdp\n0.5625\n0.0100\nNA\ngdp~I(1)\n\n\ncrt\n0.1132\n0.3419\n0.2553\ncrt~I(n)\n\n\nunemp\n0.7376\n0.7392\n0.0196\nunemp~I(2)\n\n\nnloan\n0.9536\n0.5166\n0.1664\nnloan~I(n)\n\n\nlexport\n0.9798\n0.9900\n0.0892\nlexport~I(2)\n\n\nlimport\n0.6601\n0.6736\n0.2379\nlimport~I(n)\n\n\naord\n0.8289\n0.0169\nNA\naord~I(1)\n\n\nlexr\n0.8915\n0.0473\nNA\nlexr~I(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 Unit root test for all data\nSince the second-order difference may remove part of the long-term information (such as trends) in the data, this may be detrimental to time series data such as \\(cpi_i\\) and \\(crt_i\\) that contain important trend information. Therefore, only first-order differences are used for all data."
